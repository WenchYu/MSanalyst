should be downloaded and unzipped into the cloned folder.
# Quickstart
Before applying MNA, raw mass spectrometry (MS) data should be converted using [MSconvert](https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/data_conversion.html). 
It is recommended to use [MZmine-based untargeted LC-MS workflow](https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/workflows/lcmsworkflow/lcms-workflow.html) 
to generate the `quant.csv` and `mgf` files as inputs. 

Using `-h` for help messages and there are two subcommands in MNA: 

`main` for Default analysis workflow of MNA.

`mn` for quick re-analysis of the results generated by `main` command.

Here we briefly introduce the command of MNA quick start:

`python MNA.py main -q /example/example_quant.csv -m example.mgf`
