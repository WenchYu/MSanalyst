    "*The spectral similarity algorithms have been demonstrated to exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness comparing with classic cosine-based similarity. However Collision energy and the differences in mass spectrometries can vary widely in practical applications, especially in untargeted analyses where the sample composition is unknown. Therefore, we recommend using all algorithms for clustering to identify effective algorithm combinations that best suit the specific dataset.*\n",
    "Since GNPS supports single cosine-based similarity for both library searching and feature organization. MSanalyst incorporates additional 45 algorithms allowing users to interpret their metabolomic data from multiple perspectives. Some of them are originated from basic algorithms, which can reduce noise or increase the influence of individual fragments on the final similar score by adding weight factors, normalization, etc. Therefore, we recommend first using **modified_cosine, neutral_loss, entropy, symmetric_chi_squared, euclidean and ms_for_id to make sure their efficiency, and then use their modified versions.**"

    "The algorithm is straightforward to just consider the fragmentation pattern of the spectra and overlook the influence of intensities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tandem mass spectra preprocessing, signals ≤ 1% intensity of the highest peak are usually considered noise. After a manual inspection of MNA’s experimental mass spectral library, some essential fragment ions still exist, mixed in with amounts of noise signals even after employing this noise-removing operation. It is an obstacle to deciding a general standard for noise-removing. There is another part of MS2 spectra predicted by CFM-ID in MNA’s library. Although the CFM-ID model is well-designed and applies state-of-the-art machine learning modules, it is impossible for in-silico fragments to follow real-world cleavage laws. Unexpected simulated fragments will undoubtedly affect the comparison of $ MS^2 $ spectra.\n",
    "Considering the reasons mentioned above, we designed a new mass spectral similarity algorithm called peak percentage (Supplementary Fig. 3). It counts all matched peaks without a user-defined mass error, and the count is divided into the total number of peaks to get the final score. In practical use, we advise using this scoring method after the $MS1$ filtering procedure. The absolute number of matched peak counts (MPC) was also used synergistically to restrict meaningless comparisons of oversimplified spectra.\n"
