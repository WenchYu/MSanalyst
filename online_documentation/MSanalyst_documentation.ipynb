    "# Data analysis with MSanalyst\n",
    "Msanalyst has four main functional modules, the `Molecular Networking` as main pipeline for mapping the overall profile of the metabolomic features, the `Reanalysis` to quickly find a suitable combination of parameters and algorithms, the `Spectrum Searching` section to perform single MS comparison against the entire MSanalyst library , and the `Customed Database` allowing users to generate their own MS library for special purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecualr Networking\n",
    "This is the main pepline of MSanalyst. Annotations are obtained by MS comparison and structural infomation can be propagated through edges in molecular networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data requirements\n",
    "Feature quantification table (CSV format) and MS<sup>2</sup> spectral file (MGF format) are needed. In brief, data conversion is the first step to generate standardized MS data(mzML or mzXML format). MSconvert can handle all the raw data from different vendors, except for Burker using its own DataAnalysis software to fullfill the conversion.\n",
    "We recommend MZmine to preprocess the converted 'mzML' or 'mzxML' data, including five necessary steps: mass detection, chromatogram builder, chromatogram deconcolution, feature alignment and feautre export. Details in [MZmine documentation](https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/workflows/lcmsworkflow/lcms-workflow.html) about untargeted LC-MS workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "You can use the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python main.py  -q ./example/example_quant.csv -m ./example/example.mgf -o ./example/\n",
    "```\n",
    "or click the 'Molecular Networking' button from the MSanalyst main page:\n",

    "A result file will be generated at the specific directory by the `-o` option and named after by basename of the 'example_quant.csv'. The result folder structure are listed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./MN_result.jpg\" alt=\"MN_result\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of every kind of file is listed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Folders named by 'row ID': These numbers are the same as the 'row ID' column within Feature quantification table input by `-q` option. In each folder, every MS2 comparison result and related spectra (MGF format) are kept for further investigation. The detailed information (e.g. reference id, spectral similarity) are recorded in the corresponding table with E representing experimental library and IS representing in-silico library.\n",
    "<img src=\"./node_results.jpg\" alt=\"node_results\" width=\"500\">\n",

    "2. 'E_MS1match_example_quant.csv', 'IS_MS1match_example_quant.csv' are the summary of match results in each folder.\n",

    "3. `example_modified_cosine_0.7_5.graphml` is the network file and can be directly drag into Cytoscape for visualization. We provide a template, using preset colors and shapes to display node and edge information.\n",
    "This network was generated using four spectral similarity algorithms, neutral loss and symmetric chi squared for clustering and modified cosine and peak percentage for annotating.\n",
    "features are categorized into different levels based on the library search results. Specifically, if no MS1 match is found within the defined mass tolerance (e.g. 5 ppm), features will be annotated as category A, indicating the highest level of novelty. MS1 matched features will be further compared at MS2 level and classified into level B (matched by experimental spectra) or level C (matched by in-silico spectra). Depending on the user-defined MS2 similarity threshold and matched peaks count (MPC), it can be further categorized as level 1 (meeting the defined thresholds) or 2 (not meeting the thresholds). For instance, category C1 features only have in-silico MS1 match but no MS2 match, implying only the theoretical MS1 of intrest could be found with limited structural information.\n",

    "The algorithm is straightforward to just consider the fragmentation pattern of the spectra and overlook the influence of intensities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tandem mass spectra preprocessing, signals ≤ 1% intensity of the highest peak are usually considered noise. After a manual inspection of MNA’s experimental mass spectral library, some essential fragment ions still exist, mixed in with amounts of noise signals even after employing this noise-removing operation. It is an obstacle to deciding a general standard for noise-removing. There is another part of MS2 spectra predicted by CFM-ID in MNA’s library. Although the CFM-ID model is well-designed and applies state-of-the-art machine learning modules, it is impossible for in-silico fragments to follow real-world cleavage laws. Unexpected simulated fragments will undoubtedly affect the comparison of $ MS^2 $ spectra.\n",
    "Considering the reasons mentioned above, we designed a new mass spectral similarity algorithm called peak percentage (Supplementary Fig. 3). It counts all matched peaks without a user-defined mass error, and the count is divided into the total number of peaks to get the final score. In practical use, we advise using this scoring method after the $MS1$ filtering procedure. The absolute number of matched peak counts (MPC) was also used synergistically to restrict meaningless comparisons of oversimplified spectra.\n"
